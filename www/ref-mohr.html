                <li>Article by the Director of Medical Research at Intuitive Surgical about why robotic surgery saves hospitals money.</li>
                <li>Average per procedure costs for robotic is $4,000 (Costs include instruments, amoritization and maintenance) as compared to a $900 cost per procedure for laparoscopic procedure.  That is a $3,000 difference per procedure.</li>  
                <li>Article does not specify which laparoscopic procedure. </li>
                <li>Article discusses cost savings with robotic procedures related to shorter length of stay (LOS) and reduced complications.</li>
                <li>LOS cost savings is compared to open and the author conveniently ignores laparoscopy.  Reduced complications savings not specific to specialty and can be misleading because all specialties including urology are included.</li>
