                <li>Examined the clinical and economic outcomes of minimally invasive procedures - laparoscopic (LH) and vaginal hysterectomy (VH) with the traditional open abdominal hysterectomy (AH).</li> 
                <li>Outcomes:<br />
                      - Complication rate, statistically significant:  AH-18%; LH-15%; VH-14%.<br />
                      - Length of stay, statistically significant:  AH-3.66 days; LH-1.56 days; VH-2.21.</li>
                <li>Expenditures:<br /> 
                      - Average expenditures per procedure and follow up care, statistically significant:  AH-$11,390; LH-$11,508; VH-$10,177.<br /> 
                      - Total expenditures for healthcare associated with a patient's hysterectomy.  Included all insurer and patient payments and included the cost of the surgical procedure, e.g.-follow-up office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.<br /> 
                      - If just 20% of open abdominal hysterectomies are converted to minimally invasive laparoscopic outpatient procedures, this would reduce total spending by $2,313 per procedure, which would translate to a total reduction of 3.7 billion on the healthcare system.</li>  
                <li>Patients are more likely to experience bleeding episodes and other complications after AH; infections are more frequent, as well as longer hospital stays.</li>  
                <li>LH and VH are associated with shorter hospitalizations and lower infection rates, and reduced procedure-specific complication rates. </li> 
                <li>Outpatient LH and VH require significantly less expenditures than inpatient AH, suggesting large savings could be realized by shifting appropriate candidates towards minimally invasive hysterectomy. </li>
