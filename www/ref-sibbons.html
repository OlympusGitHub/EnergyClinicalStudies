                <li>Compares thermal margins between PKS Cutting Forceps, PKS Plasma Spatula and Harmonic ACE.</li>
				<li>Thermal margins were comparable between all 3 devices.<br />
     				 - PKS Cutting Forceps:  1.59 mm; PKS Plasma Spatula:  2.38 mm; Harmonic ACE 1.67 mm.</li>
				<li>During coagulation and mechanical cutting, the PKS Cutting Forceps maximum device and tissue surface temperatures reached 75-83&ordm;C, compared to 52-68&ordm;C during cutting and 89-138&ordm;C during coagulation for the Harmonic ACE.</li>  
				<li>"100&ordm;C, represents a risk of internal thermal injury in the abdomiopelvic cavity."</li>
				<li>Harmonic produced unintentional cavitational lesions, described as "cutting ahead of itself", which may be challenging for the surgeon to visualize.</li>  
				<li>Unintentional tissue cutting occurred with Harmonic when coagulation was applied, "...despite using the MIN setting".</li>
				<li>Tissue may slip between the blades of the Harmonic ACE when cutting, leading to a decline in the precision of the instrument. </li>
