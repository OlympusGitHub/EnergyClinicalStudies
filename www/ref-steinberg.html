                <li>Based on a theoretical model and literature review of 8 robotic-assisted prostatectomy studies.</li> 
                <li>Examined the costs associated with the learning curve of the robotic prostatectomy.</li>  
                <li>Based on the literature review, the learning curve for robotic prostatectomy ranged from 20 to more than 250 cases.</li>  
                <li>In this study, the learning curve was considered the time from adoption of robotic prostatectomy until a statistically significant lowest operative time was reached.</li>  
                <li>Costs were calculated by adding the cost of the operating room time and anesthesia services over the duration of the learning curve.  Costs associated with the acquisition of the robot, instrumentation, service agreement, and drapes were not included in this cost calculation.</li>  
                <li>Over an average learning curve of 77 cases for robotic prostatectomy the total learning curve costs:  $217,034. </li>
                <li>Considering the procedure volume for the majority of urologists, it would take approximately 2 years to reach 77 cases.</li>    
                <li>This literature review did not quote reimbursement rates or instrumentation utilized in the various studies.</li>
