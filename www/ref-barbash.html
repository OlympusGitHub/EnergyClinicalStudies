                <li>Examined the variable cost of conducting a robot assisted procedure across 20 types of surgery, including gynecology.<br />   
                      - Mean cost per procedure for robotic laparoscopic hysterectomy:  $8,951.<br />  
                      - No data on what these costs include.<br />
                      - For more details on cost of the robot for gynecological procedures, please reference the following authors:  Advincula et al. (2007) and Pasic et al. (2010).</li>
                <li>Learning curve of 150-250 procedures depending on procedure and surgeon skill level.<br />
                      - For more information regarding robot learning curves please reference:  Carreyrou (2010), Lenihan et al. (2008), Payne et al. (2008), and Steinberg et al. (2008).</li>
                <li>The additional cost for the robot assisted procedure is 6% (13% when including the amortized cost of the robot itself) of the cost of the procedure in 2007.</li>  
                <li>Relating to prostatectomy procedure:  "...evidence suggests that despite the short-term benefits, robotic technology may not have improved patient outcomes or quality of life in the long run".</li>  
                <li>"Number of robot assisted procedures that are performed worldwide has nearly tripled since 2007, from 80,000 to 205,000."</li> 
                <li>Between 2007 and 2009, the number of da Vinci systems that were installed in U.S. hospitals grew by approximately 75%, from almost 800 to around 1400, while the number abroad doubled from 200 to nearly 400.</li>
