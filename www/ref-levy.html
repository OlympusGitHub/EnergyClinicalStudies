                <li>Article is an overview of vessel-sealing devices for laparoscopic procedures including:  PKS Cutting Forceps and Plasma Trissector (Trissector is no longer sold), Harmonic Scalpel, Ligamax 5 Endoscopic Multiple Clip Applier, EnSeal Tissue Sealing and Hemostasis System and EnSeal PTC, and LigaSure V.</li>
                <li>Dr. Levy's conclusions seem to be based on opinion rather than factual clinical data.<br />
                      - No numerical data were presented related to burst pressure.  <br />
                      - Please reference Lim et al. (1999) for systolic blood pressure and the "Securing Vessels" tab.</li>
                <li>Article does not favorably portray the Gyrus PKS system.</li>  
                <li>Key Points relating to "Securing Vessels" for the PK System:<br />
                      - PK devices, specifically the PKS Cutting Forceps, have been providing adequate hemostasis for over 10 years without a need for a vessel-sealing claim.<br />
                      - The PK platform has the largest array of instrument tips for the surgeon's specific needs.<br />
                      - There is a 7 mm vessel-sealing claim for the PKS SEAL Open forceps.<br />
                      - The PKS Cutting Forceps has serrated jaws to grasp onto tissue whereas tissue tends to slip through the jaws with LigaSure.<br />  
                      - PK is the only platform that provides surgeons with true bipolar cut and bipolar coagulation in one instrument.  LigaSure can coagulate with bipolar but has a monopolar cut with the Advance device.</li>
                <li>The article references Newcomb et al. (2009), and Lamberton et al. (2008).</li>
