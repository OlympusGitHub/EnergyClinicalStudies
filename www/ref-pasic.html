                <li>Analysis of 36,188 patients from 358 hospitals undergoing hysterectomy in both an inpatient and outpatient setting.</li>
                <li>Examined the clinical and economic outcomes in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy performed with and without robotic assistance in an inpatient or outpatient setting.</li>  
                <li>"The study demonstrated that there is no major or even incremental clinical benefit associated with robot assistance when considering perioperative and postoperative complications.  Robot assisted procedures are, however, associated with higher hospital costs, with an average incremental per procedure cost in excess of $2,600.  Robot assisted procedures are also associated with longer surgery times..."</li>  
                <li>Hysterectomy procedure mix:  95% laparoscopic approach; 5% robotic approach.  *Note:  A sensitivity analysis was completed to account for the difference in the numbers of non-robotic and robotic procedures, and all results were similar to those facilities that did not have a robot.</li>  
                <li>Average Cost Difference, statistically significant:<br />
                      - Inpatient cost:  Robot assisted-$9640; laparoscopic (without robot)-$6973.<br />
                      - Outpatient cost:  Robot assisted-$7920; laparoscopic (without robot)-$5949.<br />
                      - Note:  Cost measures did not include cost to acquire the robot unit ($1-2.3 million) or annual maintenance fees ($100,00-180,000 per year).  Costs reported in the paper are actual costs incurred by hospital for all treatments and services related to the hysterectomy.</li> 
                <li>Average Surgery Time, statistically significant:<br />
                      - Inpatient OR time:  Robot assisted-3.22 hours; laparoscopic (without robot)-2.82 hours.<br />
                      - Outpatient OR time:  Robot assisted-2.99 hours; laparoscopic (without robot)-2.46 hours.<br />
                      - Note:  No information provided on how OR time was measured.</li>
                <li>Average length of stay, statistically significant:  Robot assisted-1.37 days; laparoscopic-1.49 days.<br />
                      - Although the average length of stay was statistically significant, the authors reported that the difference did not represent clinical significance.  </li>
