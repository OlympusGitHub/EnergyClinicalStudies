                <li>Examined the vessel securing ability of the PKS SEAL Open Forceps on skelotonized vessels up to 7 mm in diameter to withstand sustained pressure of 300 mmHg using bench and animal models.</li>  
                <li>Mean burst pressure, among all vessel diameters:  1052 mmHg.</li>  
                <li>Thermal spread range, among all vessel diameters:  0.4-2.3 mm from closure site edge.</li>  
                <li>The PKS SEAL Open Forceps provides efficient vessel securing with the ability to withstand high intraluminal pressure.</li>
                <li>Bench model test:  Success rate of 95.5% or 64/67 vessels were secured.  Diameters of 4,5,6,7,8, and 10 mm.</li>
                <li>Animal model test:  Success rate of 95.7% or 44/46 vessels were secured.  Diameters of 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4,5,6, and 7 mm.</li>
                <li>End point burst pressures were tested in the animal model and ranged from 565 to 1934 mmHg, with a mean of 1052 mmHg.</li>  
                <li>"Using the open forceps to coagulate tissue rather than conventional clamps decreases the need for instrument exchanges and may ultimately decrease operating time with cost savings."</li>
