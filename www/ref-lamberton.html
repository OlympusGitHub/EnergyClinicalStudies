                <li>Examined the thermal spread and burst pressures of PK (device not specified, likely the Cutting Forceps), Harmonic ACE, EnSeal PTC, and LigaSure V devices, using 5 mm bovine arteries for testing.</li>
                <li>PK had the second highest mean burst pressure-290 mmHg, behind LigaSure with 385 mmHg.</li>  
                <li>"All devices tested resulted in temperatures 2 mm away from tissue that were greater than 40&ordm;C and hence should be used with caution next to vital structures...."</li>  
                <li>"Sealing times for the LigaSure (10.0 sec) and Gyrus PK (11.1 sec) were statistically faster when compared to EnSeal (19.2 sec) or Harmonic Scalpel (14.3 sec), p for both &lt; 0.001."</li>  
                <li>Potential limitations with this model include vessels without blood and an ex-vivo experimental model.</li>
                <li>Thermal spread (measured in temperature using a thermistor 2 mm from the edge of the device).  Gyrus reported at (64.5&ordm;C), LigaSure (55.5&ordm;C), EnSeal (58.9&ordm;C), and Harmonic (49.9&ordm;C).</li>
