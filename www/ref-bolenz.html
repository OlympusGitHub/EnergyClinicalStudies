                <li>Examined the cost of robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (robotic), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (laparoscopic) and open retropubic radical prostatectomy (open).</li>  
                <li>643 patients; 262 robot, 220 laparoscopic and 161 open.</li>
                <li>Total cost per patient for robotic prostatectomy:  $9,450 ($2698+$6752) *Assuming an average of 126 cases per year.<br />
                      1.  Cost of purchase and maintenance of robot:  $2698 per patient *Assuming the sum amortized purchase price of robot and annual maintenance fee divided by an average of 126 cases per year.<br />  
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;- Purchase and maintenance costs:  $340,000 per year (assumed $1.4 Million for robot; $140,000 per year maintenance fee, seven (7) year amortization, and 126 procedures per year).<br />
                      2.  Median direct cost, per patient:  Open-$4437, Laparoscopic-$5687, Robotic-$6752.<br />
                           - Direct costs are costs generated by each department involved in patient care- anesthesia, radiology, OR, surgical supplies, pathology, medication, laparotomy, and room and board.</li> 
                <li>Two (2) costs that contribute to higher median cost for robotic prostatectomy are surgical supply and OR costs.<br />
                	  1.  Surgical supply cost per procedure:  Open-$185, Laparoscopic-$725, Robotic-$2015.<br />
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;- Laparoscopic prostatectomy equipment - routine disposable laparoscopic equipment (eg. trocars, specimen entrapment sac, etc.)<br /> 
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;- Robotic prostatectomy equipment - specific surgical supply costs were for Hot Shears, large needle drivers, grasper, and ProGrasp- costing $220 per use (cost averaged over 10 uses).<br />  
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Study utilized the PKS Endowrist Dissector, costing $250 per use (cost averaged over 10 uses).<br />
                      2.  OR cost:  Open-$1611, Laparoscopic-$2453, Robotic-$2798.
                <li>Assuming equivalent OR time, robotic prostatectomy costs at least $1000 more due to surgical equipment compared to laparoscopic and open prostatectomy.</li>
