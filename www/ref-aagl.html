                <li>This special article represents the AAGL's (American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists) position regarding the laparoscopic and vaginal vs. open approach for hysterectomy.</li>
				<li>"It is the position of the AAGL that most hysterectomies for benign disease should be performed either vaginally or laparoscopically and that continued efforts should be taken to facilitate these approaches."</li>  
				<li>"When hysterectomy is necessary, the demonstrated safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic hysterectomy mandate that they be the procedures of choice."</li> 
				<li>"When hysterectomy is performed without laparotomy, early institutional discharge is feasible and safe, in many cases within the first 24 hours."</li>
				<li>Laparoscopy reduced the indirect costs of hysterectomy by as much as 50% when compared to abdominal hysterectomy.</li> 
				<li>"A number of clinical situations considered as contraindications to laparoscopic hysterectomy seem not to have merit when subjected to critical analysis".  These include obesity and previous caesarian section.</li>  
				<li>"If a large uterus or other coexisting disease or surgical considerations render vaginal hysterectomy not feasible, laparoscopic hysterectomy seems to be a safe alternative that preserves most of the advantages of vaginal hysterectomy over abdominal hysterectomy."</li>
